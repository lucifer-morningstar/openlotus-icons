# openlotus-icons
THANK you so much for checking out the first OpenLotus Theming project. I have an overall philospohy that guides the design process. I'll publish that here very soon. 

The short version: It starts from the idea that preventing eye and mental fatigue and enhancing ones ability to focus are the key goals. 

This project achieves this by darkening ambient color schemes and  thourough reductiveism when it comes to shapes as well. I find "outline" iconsets to be unnesessarily busy and over time they can fatige the viewier with shapes that are too complex for the eye to process quickly and move on from. Too many outline icons are simply ambiguous or indistinct from surrounding ones.    it's about using contrast not color to define shapes. Very sparing use of colors to enhance their utility as "eye'attractors" to visual cues like colored indicators and such that add visual info that is of use.

//more stuff here....(it's a WIP, y'all!) 


This results in a spartan style.


Linux desktop iconset for Plasma and GTK+

Install: place the set in either $HOME/.local/share/icons/ or /usr/share/icons/ to install system wide. 

NOTE about GTK+: 
It seems as though GTK+ apps do not see the ison set if installed for local only. 

If anyone has an idea what the deelio is with that let me know.
